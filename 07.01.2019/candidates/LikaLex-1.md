### Short Description

Timetress is a gem that helps keep track of holidays. 

Among these holidays, Christmas was only Catholic (December 24 - Christmas Eve, 25 - Christmas). As an orthodox person, I was slightly upset, so I decided to add  to this calendar: January 6th - the Orthodox Christmas Eve and January 7th - Orthodox Christmas
